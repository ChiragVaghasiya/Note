Hi Alvaro,



Please find today's status as below:



• Requirement understanding - Completed. I have added few points below. I need more information on those topics.
• Features and code mapping - Completed.
• Implementation - Started with this.



Points where more clarity is needed:
• Accounting margin : Cost of sales as per accounting valuation method - I need more information on this one.
• Other commission (base value is another commission, in this case show Many2many field related to employees to select commission
from which employees )
• Rule Type (rule_type – Selection, determines if the basis for the calculation of this commission is just the triggered amount, or if amount from this rule should be accrued according to period field and commission calculation done to total amount at period end)
- One-shot
- Cumulative



Thanks,
Ramesh
